My Lab Project on Human Computer Interaction Course. 

And uh, I have bad skill in designing, that's why my design doesn't looks good :). And y'all can access it, by typing in NS2006.github.io on web, and y'all can see my bad website :).
(Note: There will be some minor problem or bug, because of some adjustment from github, but yeah, overall the code itself still works).
